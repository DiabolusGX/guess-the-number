# Guess The Number

Hi! Booster Bot can manage, track & log the server boosts events for you in your server.
From sending thankyou/greet message to assigning auto roles on server boost.. .
To allowing boosters to maintain their own personal role (only name and color)


# Getting Started

Setup is quite simple. You can start with **bb help setup** and mainly only 1 command to setup.

## Setup

You can start with `gg help setup` to see what configurations you can edit & you want to set.
- _You can remove any config anytime by setting it's value to  `disable`_
_ex :  `bb setup manager disable`  will remove bot manager role._

Setup command will let you add/edit/remove bot settings like :

| Command   |      Example |  Usage |
|----------|:-------------|:-------|
| prefix |  `gg setup prefix !` | It'll change prefix to `!` |
| manager|  `gg setup manager @mods` | Mods role will be able to manage bot settings |
| DM |  `gg setup dm enable` | Bot will DM to the winner of the game |
| win-role|  `gg setup win-role @winners` | Bot will add winners role to the winner |
| req-role|  `gg setup req-role @level50` | Users only with this role will be eligible to guess the number |
| lock-role|  `gg setup lock-role @level50` | Bot will lock channel for this role after game is over |

## Start Game

To **start game** admin or bot-manager need to enter just 1 command :
`gg start <min> <max> [channel]` - Bot will start game in mentioned channel (current channel, if not mentioned) with a random number between `min` & `max` value provided.
- Bot will DM the answer to the game organizer (who runs the command)
- Bot will pin the game start and game end message, lock the channel after game ends for given role and add "ðŸ”’" emoji to channel name.
- Make sure to remove pins and "ðŸ”’" from channel before sarting next game to avoid confusion.

To **give hint** if you feel game is too difficult you can use :
`gg hint <first | last | number> [channel]`
- `first` - shows 1st digit of answer.
- `last` - shows last digit of answer.
- `number` - Tells if answer is smaller or greater then given number.

## Wins

When someone wins bot will add points to thet users and add a role (If enabled by admins)
- How many points bot will add?
- - 1/10 th of the difference between `max` and `min` number in game.

- What are points gonna do?
- - Nothing as of now, but there is gonna be a leaderboard and some purchasable items or roles with points.
